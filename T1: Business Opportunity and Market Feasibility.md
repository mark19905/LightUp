# T1: Business Opportunity and Market Feasibility 
## LightUp: Business Concept Overview
The main goal for our company is to specialize in creating a smartphone that is affordable, customizable, and resourceful that you don't have to waste more than a month's salary to afford.
We are a small online retail company, we want to specifically target teenagers that want a affordable phone, and adults who want a practical and easy to use phone.
Since we'll only operate through our online store, we won't be competing with major phone brands.

- A customer segment we would like to target is teenagers who are on a reduced budget when buying a new smartphone.
Essentially, we're trying to keep their best interest in mind when developing a phone that is compatible with most software,
can run most applications and games. 

- We want this smartphone to be customizable, the customer will be able to design the phone to their own liking in a way that makes it unique.
Our phone will come in two modes, one is fun and creative which will run on the Android platform. In it the user
can do a variety of things like, downloading games, customizing splashscreens, and draw. Our second mode,
which is a business office approach will appeal to college students and business workers will have the user toggle a switch on their phone.
After toggling the switch, the phone's layout will be switched to a more simplified, easy to access, and clean layout.
In this layout the user can edit documents, send professional emails, and send PDFs to people.

- Since our phone is meant to be for people on a reduced budget, we have decided that best option is to make the phone out of plastic, but, have
it be a swappable design, that way people can change what they don't like about the design. Our form of selling will be through online retail.
We chose this approach because we deemed it necessary to cut out middleman retailers to maintain our phone below $300.

- Our customer segment is lower to middle class people who have an interest in a phone, but don't feel a practical phone has to break their wallet.
Several examples include college students who are on a budget and can't afford the latest phone, but want a phone that isn't slow and can run most apps.
Another example includes business workers who are interns or just got recently hired that need a practical phone that is compatible with most business
related apps, such as PowerPoint, Office 365, and Google Docs. After this initial segment, we hope to expand our brand later in the future so we can appeal
to more audiences. We believe that for now, targeting the lower to middle class is a sizeable range that will result in profits.

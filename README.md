# LightUp

## Summary of LightUp
The main goal for our company is to specialize in creating a smartphone that is affordable, customizable, and resourceful that you don't have to waste more than a month's salary to afford. We are a small online retail company, we want to specifically target teenagers that want a affordable phone, and adults who want a practical and easy to use phone. Since we'll only operate through our online store, we won't be competing with major phone brands.

      <p>LightUp wants to deliver a good quality phone to kids and adults while providing a simple and affordable experience for their
        phones.<br>
      The main issue LightUp is trying to solve is affordability. We know that not anyone can afford a new phone that major brands release every year. While we're not competing with major brands, we hope to target a small audience and grow from there. <br>
      We're starting with our Arcadius series which will include a physical button on the back that will switch the phone from a gaming or social media mode to a more simpler, business professional design that has apps such as Microsoft's Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and etc. <br>

      <p>We plan on making more phone with different upgrades in future if our launch is successful. This is why our customer relationship will be continuous so we can get loyal customers to continue buying our phones.</p>

      <p>LightUp wants to deliver a good quality phone to kids and adults while providing a simple and affordable experience for their
        phones. We hope to target kids and adults as they are two giant groups and we hope to later expand into the elderly and other groups.</p>

      <p>Our key activities are product,staff,finance, and Intellectual. We provide a physical product so all of these are necessary to 
        ensure customer satisfaction. We'll rent our headquarter here in the Omaha area since it has the required assets like banks and warehouses.<br>

      <p>Through our website we can reach our customers and get the information we need from them to provide them a simple and easy
        experience when buying a new phone. We're also planning to reach out to people through social media as it seems to be a 
        inexpensive and easy way to advertise.

      <p>We'll hire an accounting team to handle the costs and deal with taxes. Our main costs will be the key resource which include phone parts which we'll buy in bulk from suppliers. Then we will send the parts and design to a factory outside of the U.S. where they will manufacture the phones and we'll store them at our warehouse.<br>

      <b><a href="https://github.com/mark19905/LightUp/blob/master/T5:%20Financial%20Plan.md">Revenue Streams</a></b>
      <p>Our financial plan starts off with crowdfunding money through platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Any additional money that we require can be taken out as a loan with Wells Fargo. We felt this is the best approach because there is less risk involved and the loan won't be high. After our initial setup, we hope to gather funds from people ordering our phones through our website. Those who crowd funded us will get discounts and offers. </p>

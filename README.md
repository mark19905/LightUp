T1: Business Opportunity & Market Feasibility 
https://github.com/mark19905/LightUp/blob/master/T1:%20Business%20Opportunity%20and%20Market%20Feasibility.md

The main goal for our company is to specialize in creating a smartphone that is affordable, customizable, and resourceful that you don't have to waste more than a month's salary to afford. We are a small online retail company, we want to specifically target teenagers that want a affordable phone, and adults who want a practical and easy to use phone. Since we'll only operate through our online store, we won't be competing with major phone brands.

# LightUp

## Summary of LightUp
The main goal for our company is to specialize in creating a smartphone that is affordable, customizable, and resourceful that you don't have to waste more than a month's salary to afford. We are a small online retail company, we want to specifically target teenagers that want a affordable phone, and adults who want a practical and easy to use phone. Since we'll only operate through our online store, we won't be competing with major phone brands.

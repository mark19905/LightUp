# T2: Channels & Customer Relationships

**Team Leader:** Mark Lopez

- Our main form of customer engagement will be through online retail. Online retail will help LightUp reduce costs and keep our product affordable to every customer by cutting out the middleman and retail stores.
Since our store is going to be online we'll be able to get people all across the U.S. to view our phones, and we can see what states would our phone be more popular in. An online store will also make it easy for customers to come to us when they have issues by visiting a support page on our website.
We intend this to appeal our product to appeal from teens through adults (14-28). While this does not mean other people can't use our product, we hope our product targets this specific group.
 
- We have decided to take a social media approach to advertise to our customers. Some ways we are planning to target customer is through scoial media video ads. 
Social medias like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat have settings on what area you want to target customers from, age range, and interests. This can be very advantageous because target specific groups rather than hope we attract different types of customers through normal ads.

- One of the benefits of using social media is that we can offer support to our customers directly through our online platforms. We will have an email support team that can assist customers on any issues with their phone though our website. Our online platform will have a way to send messages or questions to our team and they will send back a response through email.
Live support is a feature we want to test out since we feel faster support results in better feedback from the customer. We will also have traditional methods of communication like a phone number, and a address so customers can send defective phones or send them to us for repairs.
We hope through these methods we can appeal to most customers and make our company successful.
